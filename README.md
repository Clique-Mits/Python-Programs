29.Write a program to multiply two matrices "Consider a system for a Vigenere cipher system. The system consists of a matrix which is filled with a set of predefined values (even though it is normally considered for strings, we take it for numbers). The matrix is filled like: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 Enter a number. Then take adjacent digits and lookup the table with 1st digit forming the row number and 2nd digit forming the column number. Then display the digit at that location. Repeat it for the rest of the number."

30.Write a program to convert a matrix to a sparse matrix. A sparse matrix is a special notation where only non-zero values of the matrix are represented using the notation <row number , column number , value>

37.Write a program to sort a set of strings using bubble sort

38.Write a program to compare two strings irrespective of the case without using any library function

39.Write a program to count the number of words in a string without using any library function

40.Write a program to reverse the odd words in a string without using any library function

41.Write a program to replace the occurrence of 'the' with 'a' in a string without using any library function. Replacement should occur even if 'the' occurs within a word

42.Write a program to accept a string and count the number of digits, capital letters and small letters without using any library function

43.Write a program to reverse the order of words in a string. You may use library functions

52.Write a function implementation to reverse a string without using any library function

53.Write a program to implement a sorting system for numbers using functions

54."Write a user-defined function that finds the square root of a number without using any library function. The square root can be found out like below. Consider 40. 36<40<49 So, square root lies between 6 and 7. Take the average. You get 6.5. The square is 42.25. So, the square root lies between 6 and 6.5. Again take average to get 6.25. The process repeats. Continue for a maximum of 6 iterations."56.
